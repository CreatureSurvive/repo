A simplistic yet powerful color picker for use in PreferenceLoader preference bundles. Supports iOS 9 - 11, other iOS versions
have not been tested.

Best when used with [libCSPreference](https://creaturesurvive.github.io/repo/cydia/libcspreferences/depiction/) but also works fine on it's own.
For usage info and resources, check out libCSColorPicker on [GitHub](https://github.com/CreatureSurvive/libCSColorPicker), soon to be open sourced.
